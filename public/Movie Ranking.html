<h1>TRILO3Y PRODUCTIONS: Greatest Hits</h1>

<h2>Here are some great movies listed by TRILO3Y PRODUCTIONS.</h2> 
<hr />
<p>Admittedly, not all of these movies are objectively well made, but they are ones held dear nonetheless.</p>

<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>Need I say more? It's the Matrix!This series singlehandedly changed not only the film world, but the real world as well.</p>

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>Need I say more? It's Star Wars! This series singlehandedly changed not only the film world, but the real world as well. </p>

<h3>ALIEN</h3>
<p>Need I say more? It's Star Wars! This series singlehandedly changed not only the film world, but the real world as well.</p>

<h3>Rango</h3>
<p>Okay, now this one might need some explanation. It may not be a theatrical juggernaut like the others, but it's still a hidden gem.</p>
<p>This movie was way ahead of its time. I was only a lad on my first viewing, and I loved every second of it. Being so young, though, a lot went over my head. It wasn't until I rewatched the animated movie as an adult that I was able to fully appreciate it in all its chaotic glory.</p>

<h3>The Lego Movie</h3>
<p>Again, maybe this one isn't the most widely loved movie in the world, but it's one of the greats in my personal opinion. The message is simple, that anyone can be special. There is no secret ingredient. No, wait. Wrong movie. Anyone can be a master builder! Even a regular nobody like Emit.</p>
<p>While this movie was certainly marketed for children (which I was when I saw it in theaters), it also has great value for adults. Namely, don't become President Business!</p>
