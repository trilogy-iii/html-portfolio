<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>ようこそ、Welcome! My name is Curtis Pitchford III. I'm a young multi-media specialist, polyglot and web developer. I've had a passion for film and technology and language from a young age. I was inspired by characters like Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark and have been on a mission to create ever since.</p>

<p>In middle school I studied perfoming arts such as band and theater. In high school, I studied robotics and manufacturing at a career academy. In college, I studied film, 3D modeling and animation. Even after graduation, I've continued my education through my love for learning new languages. As of 2025, I have been studying Spanish and Japanese for over 5 years, and I'm thinking of picking up Korean. But there are more languages than the kind you speak! I am also currently learning several programming languages online, such as HTML5, CSS, Python and Javascript.</p>

<p>While I may never be a super genius like Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne, my goal is to be as smart, capable and interesting as I can be; the best version of me. </p>
